  fpw_german_confederation_category_desc:0 "Since the Treaty of Vienna, the Germans have been united once again under the German Confederation, the successor to the Holy Roman Empire. However, diverse opinions are all over the confederation. Some want the confederation to evolve into a single, unified country, while others wish for its dissolution."

  fpw_austro_prussian_PRS_desc:0 "Since his employment as the German Chancellor, Otto von Bismarck has wanted to achieve German unification. However, this will only be possible if Prussia can demonstrate to the other German states, especially Austria, that it can effectively rule the many states within the German sphere of influence."
  fpw_austro_prussian_AUS_desc:0 "Since the German-Danish War in 1864, our aim has been to demonstrate our dominance over the other German states. Now, the opportune moment has arrived to assert our supremacy by winning a war against the formidable Prussians."
  fpw_austro_prussian_desc:0 "In 1864, the German states of Prussia and Austria fought bravely against the Danes. This conflict is now recognized as the First German Unification War, and the possibility of a second war is imminent. It is now upon us to decide which side of German supremacy within the German Confederation we wish to support."

  fpw_austro_prussian_PRS_war_desc:0 "After the glorious victory of our Army at Königgrätz, [AUS.GetNameDef] was left in disarray, unable to reorganize. Our united forces now have the opportunity to push them out of our sphere of influence once and for all. The time has come to ratify this triumph under the Treaty of Vienna and firmly establish Prussian supremacy over [AUS.GetNameDef]! The road to German unification is within our grasp, and none shall stand in our way."
  fpw_austro_prussian_AUS_war_desc:0 "With the [PRS.GetAdjective] Army overwhelming our brave soldiers at Königgrätz, we have been left defenseless. The crushing defeat has left us with no choice but to accept our fate and begin the arduous task of rebuilding our nation. The terms laid out by [PRS.GetNameDef] will shape our future, and we must now navigate this new reality with resilience and determination. The dream of Austrian dominance in Germany has faded, but our spirit endures."
  fpw_austro_prussian_war_desc:0 "In a swift and unexpected turn of events, the [PRS.GetAdjective] forces secured a decisive victory at Königgrätz, a small but pivotal town in Bohemia. This triumph marked a defining moment in the Second War of German Unification. The high casualties inflicted upon [AUS.GetNameDef] left their defenses in shambles, effectively ending their resistance. The balance of power in Central Europe has shifted dramatically, and the path to [PRS.GetAdjective] hegemony now seems all but assured. The Treaty of Vienna will undoubtedly formalize this new order, reshaping the political landscape for generations to come."
